## Setup

Install Deno 2.4 using your preferred method--typically this would be your
system's package manager. See [Deno's installation instructions][DenoInstall] to find the
command that's right for you.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore-end -->

This repo was developed against Deno 2.4.2.

## Common tasks

Most of the commands you'll need are provided by the Deno toolchain. You can run
tasks either from the repo root or within each package

### Building the server

```sh
cd server
deno task build
```

This is set up to output an x86_64 Linux ELF at `server/build/server`. You can
override the target architecture if necessary by setting the `ARCH` environment
variable; [see the docs here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/compile/#supported-targets) for possible values.

### Building the frontend

While you don't have to worry too much about it for this exercise, you might
want to try building the frontend:

```sh
cd client
deno task build
```

### Typechecking

```sh
deno check .
```
